### Nightlife App

The concept for the nightlife app is to be an app that bars and clubs could use to show: 
how long the lines are at each establishment at any given time,
what the cover charge is,
how full the bar/club is,
prices of food or drinks,
and current or upcomming promotions

This app would be a extremely helpful for patrons to determine whether or not they would choose that establishment or another. The app would also have a yelp style aspect as well where patrons who checked in on the app could review the bar or club.

The rating for each bar/club would be an aggregate of the all the reviews posted.
