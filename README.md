### Nightlife App

The concept for the nightlife app is to be an app that bars and clubs could use to show: 
how long the wait is at any given time,
what the cover charge is,
how full the bar/club is,
prices of food or drinks,
and current or upcoming promotions

This app would be a extremely helpful for patrons to determine whether or not they would choose that establishment or another. The app would also have a yelp style aspect as well where patrons who checked in on the app could review the bar or club.

The rating for each bar/club would be an aggregate of the all the reviews posted.
The app will use a database in order to save the rating of each of the scores.


To create this app I will be using xcode 7 as the IDE and swift as the programming language.

Typical use case:

A user would be presented with a login screen. If the user is a patron after logging in they will be presented with a list of bar/clubs. Under the name of each bar/club would be the cover charge, wait time, crowd density, and current promotions. The user will be able to reorder this list based on any of these 4 fields. If a user wants to learn more about a bar/club on the list all they have to do is tap it which will then bring then to the bar/club's personal page that has their score,pictures,description, address, and food/drink prices as well as any information from the previous page. On this page the user also has the option to check in to the bar/club. If the user does check in then they can leave a review of the bar/club. If the user is a bar/club upon logging in they will be brought to a page with infromation that they can edit and fill in. In the top right corner of any screen will be a gear that any user can tap which will then prompt the user if they are sure they would like to log out.
